# Plan

Checkboxes track open work. Items can be done in any order; the order below is
only a suggested grouping.

- [ ] Move `pukan/vulkan/` to a separate subpackage so `pukan.vulkan` can be
      used independently of the rest of `pukan`. Keep module names unchanged.
- [ ] Check format availability before use. `VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SFLOAT` and
      similar are not mandatory: query `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties`
      (and `vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties` for images) instead of
      assuming the format is usable.

## Open GitHub issues

- [ ] Resolve the tracker backlog. Discuss each item before starting work.
  - [ ] #5 Add `Scene.surfaces`: support more than one surface for stereo and
        mirrors. `Scene` currently holds one `surface`; stereo uses two
        viewports on it.
  - [ ] #6 Wrap `CommandPool` into `ScopedLogicalDeviceTemplateMixin`.
  - [ ] #7 GPU-stored objects tree: keep node transforms, or at least the
        whole-tree matrices, in a GPU buffer. `Bone.translationBufferIdx` is
        unused, and only skin matrices are uploaded today.
  - [ ] #9 TODO list
    - [ ] Remove `updateDescriptorSetsAndUniformBuffers` and rely on RAII.
  - [ ] #11 glTF animation on GPU: sample and interpolate animation in a
        compute shader. Only joint matrices are computed on the GPU today.
  - [ ] #15 Add USD/USDA/USDC support.
  - [ ] #16 Add terrain support.

## Content formats

- [ ] Spike: evaluate Godot GridMap support. It stores a 3D tile map as cells on
      an integer grid with a mesh library per cell; decide whether to import that
      data as is or to grow the same cell-and-library model on top of #16.

## Geometric algebra: PGA and CGA

- [ ] Spike: evaluate adding PGA (Projective Geometric Algebra) and CGA
      (Conformal Geometric Algebra).

A seed entry: its presence should be taken into account when the other engine
components are designed and developed. PGA suits graphics better, but CGA is
sometimes needed: fractals, spheres, complex smooth surfaces (signed distance
fields).

## 2D

- [ ] 2D overlay on top of 3D: sprite/quad batch, alpha blending, orthographic
      projection, drawn after the 3D pass.
- [ ] OSD: debug text and small overlays (FPS, counters, flags).
- [ ] Object labels once the OSD exists: project an object's origin to the screen
      and draw its name there, glTF nodes and meshes first; overlapping,
      off-screen and behind-the-camera labels need their own handling.
- [ ] Menu: prefer a ready-made solution (dimgui, bindbc-imgui, GTK, ...) and
      evaluate how it integrates with the existing frame loop.

Questions:

- Overlay via an immediate-mode library or a custom sprite batch?
- How is text rendered: font atlas, signed distance field, or the UI library?

## Automatic composition: pipelines into render passes, passes into a frame

Goal: drawables declare what they write, and the composer groups compatible
pipelines into render passes/subpasses and records one frame.

Current state: one `DefaultRenderPass`; pipelines are cached by `PipelineFactory`,
command recording is done by hand in `Frame`/`FrameBuilder`.

Ideas:

1. **Dynamic rendering.** The instance already requests Vulkan 1.3
   (`makeApiVersion(0, 1, 3, 0)`). With `dynamicRendering` enabled, pipelines
   declare color/depth formats directly and a pass is just
   `vkCmdBeginRendering` / `vkCmdEndRendering`, so `VkRenderPass`,
   `VkFramebuffer` and subpass dependencies disappear. This removes most of the
   "pipeline into render pass" problem. The feature itself fits the existing
   device requirement system.
2. **Frame graph.** Passes declare reads and writes of resources; the frame is
   ordered by a topological sort; barriers are derived from those declarations;
   transient resources can alias. Stronger and more work.
3. **Simple grouping rule.** Group consecutive drawables that target the same
   attachment set; split a pass when attachments or load/store ops differ;
   insert subpass dependencies for read-after-write.

Because the goal is vague here, the questions below decide the scope:

- What does "automatic" mean: compile-time generation of passes, or runtime
  sorting of draw calls into passes?
- Which targets are needed: swapchain only, or offscreen (shadow maps, HDR,
  post-processing)?
- Is a depth prepass needed?
- Can the project require Vulkan 1.3 with dynamic rendering, or must it keep
  `VkRenderPass`?
- Should the 2D overlay be a separate pass after the 3D pass, or a subpass of
  the same render pass?
- Are pipelines created at scene setup or on first use?

## Materials

The shared `Material` covers unlit/lit shading, glTF metallic-roughness and the
`KHR_materials_*` extensions. The following pieces are still missing:

- [ ] Shader tiers for glTF materials. Split the uber shader into core PBR and
      extended (specular/IOR, clearcoat, sheen) variants once the benchmark shows
      register or instruction cache pressure; the branches are uniform today, so
      the gain has to be measured before the pipelines multiply.
- [ ] Multiple skins per glTF file. Stop hardcoding `skins[0]` and bind the skin
      per node and primitive.
- [ ] Texture compression. KTX2/BasisU and other compressed formats with a
      fallback path.

### Transparency

Opaque, mask (through alpha-to-coverage) and blend are covered, but blended
draws are sorted back to front by the depth of their node origin, so
overlapping and self-intersecting transparent meshes come out in the wrong
order. Missing:

- [ ] Order-independent transparency for the blended queue: keep the fragments
      of each pixel, as a per-pixel linked list or an A-buffer, and resolve them
      in depth order after the pass. Removes the per-draw sort, so a transparent
      mesh that crosses itself or another one stops flickering as the camera
      moves.
- [ ] Transmission copies the colour once per frame, so glass behind glass shows
      the scene without the first pane, and the screen-space refraction offset
      can pull in a neighbour at the silhouette. Depth-aware rejection or a
      second bounce would fix both.

### Material seams and white dots

The dots on the helmet and the orange had two causes, both fixed: specular
aliasing where the normal map changes faster than a pixel, and a degenerate
normal-map texel at an island edge turning into a NaN normal. What is left on
the black helmet's ridges is the Fresnel rim, which only temporal
antialiasing smooths.

If dots show up elsewhere, in this order:

- [ ] Compare sampler states: CLAMP_TO_EDGE vs MIRRORED_REPEAT, nearest vs
      linear, with and without mipmaps.
- [ ] Check UV islands and texture borders: sampling across an island edge can
      pull the opposite or border texel; use clamped samplers or gutters.
- [ ] Compare culling: back-face culling vs none, and check the front-face
      winding. Holes that vanish indicate reversed or missing triangles.
- [ ] Inspect shared edges between primitives for duplicated vertices,
      T-junctions and floating-point differences; overlap or weld them.
- [ ] Check depth precision and z-fighting at coplanar seams.

## Lighting

The frame carries one directional light and up to eight point lights; there are
no shadows and no spot lights. Missing:

- [ ] Move the light list into a storage buffer, add spot lights and make the
      sun one entry of it instead of a fixed uniform.
- [ ] Shadow maps. A cascaded directional map first, then an atlas for the
      local lights; both need a depth-only pass, so they follow the pass
      composition above.
- [ ] Shadow filtering: PCF, normal offset bias and cascade blending.
- [ ] Light culling by distance and screen size.

## Deferred shading

The other way to separate geometry from materials: batch geometry by pipeline
alone and resolve the material in a second pass. A different frame shape, not a
better draw path, and it comes after the forward batch path has been measured.

- [ ] A G-buffer pass: depth, normal, UV, base color and a material id per pixel,
      written by every opaque drawable with the same pipeline.
- [ ] A shading pass that reads the G-buffer and applies the material its id
      points at, sampling textures through the same descriptor array the forward
      path needs.
- [ ] Keep alpha-blended and transmissive materials on a forward path, and
      decide whether masked ones go to the G-buffer.
- [ ] Judge it on the fixed scene against the forward palette and texture
      indexing: the deferred path pays MRT bandwidth and a full-screen pass, and
      on llvmpipe it is expected to lose. It earns its place only if the draws
      or the overdraw it removes outweigh that.

## Temporal antialiasing

Per-pixel shading aliases over time: a specular highlight or a Fresnel rim one
pixel wide jumps between pixels as the camera or the object moves, and MSAA
cannot fix it because MSAA averages coverage, not shading. The black helmet's
ridges show it as white dots that come and go at half a turn. Jittering the
projection and accumulating frames averages those pixels out, which no
per-pixel fix can do. It also smooths edges beyond 4x MSAA, and the history
buffer is what screen-space reflections, temporal shadows and upscaling would
need later.

- [ ] Jitter the projection by a subpixel offset per frame, cycling a fixed
      sample pattern; undo the jitter for picking.
- [ ] Keep a history colour buffer and reproject it with the previous
      view-projection.
- [ ] Reject history where depth or the normal moved, and clamp it to the
      current neighbourhood so moving objects do not ghost.
- [ ] Resolve between the surface pass and the colour copy, so transmission
      still samples an antialiased image.
- [ ] Judge it on the fixed scene against 4x MSAA without TAA: the aliasing it
      removes, the ghosting it adds, and its cost on llvmpipe.

## Data layout and throughput

Thesis: the remaining speed is in reducing the entropy of the data that moves
through the pipeline, not in macros and not in rewriting CPU loops as compute
shaders. Fewer bytes on the bus and in the caches mean fewer misses and fewer
stalled stages; every item below is a way of sending less, or sending it in a
more predictable order.

Each item earns its place only with numbers: VRAM occupied, bytes per instance
uploaded per frame, cache misses, frame time on a fixed scene. The baseline is
recorded in `bench/baseline.md`, and the quantization and instancing items are
the near-term ones; the first touches the vertex layout that the mesh merge now
owns, the second the draw path. The rest are long-term spikes, each judged
against the plain version it replaces.

- **Instanced static primitives**
  - [ ] Batch any mesh that shares vertex and index buffers, pipeline variant
        and texture set into one instanced draw, not glTF primitives only: the
        loader is the first producer, not the boundary. The transform moves from
        the push constant into an instance buffer, and the material becomes a
        palette the fragment shader indexes by the instance instead of a
        descriptor set per mesh. One batch carries one texture set, so materials
        with different textures split it. The sphere and cylinder renderers
        already issue instanced draws from compute-built commands and stay as
        they are.
  - [ ] Skinned meshes join the same batch while they share a pose, which is one
        joint matrix buffer: the shader applies the instance transform after
        skinning, so a crowd in lockstep costs one draw. Different poses split
        into batches, each still instanced.
  - [ ] Drop the texture set from the batch key: index textures from the
        material through one descriptor array sampled with
        `descriptorIndexing`, and store image and sampler indices in the
        material. Bounded by the after-bind descriptor limits and by the
        per-material sampler state; do it after the palette, when batches still
        split on textures.
  - [ ] Measure on the iridescence grid: 346 primitives over two geometry sets,
        343 nodes differing only in translation and material. One llvmpipe draw
        costs about 0.11 ms whatever the triangle count, so the grid spends
        29 ms of its 32 ms there; with one draw the target is the shader and
        setup that remain, about 14 ms.

- **Quantized static geometry**
  - [ ] Optional extreme quantization for static batches: store positions and
        rotations in as few as 2 bits per component when the drawable is authored
        on a local grid, and decode in the vertex shader. Saves VRAM and removes
        the vertex stage's memory bottleneck; the precision budget is per batch,
        and the unquantized layout stays the default.

- **Motors instead of matrices**
  - [ ] Upload instance transforms as motors (dual quaternions, 8 floats)
        instead of `mat4` (16 floats) in the transform SSBO, which halves the
        traffic for the dynamic path.
  - [ ] Interpolate skinned animation in motor space instead of blending
        matrices, which removes the shear and scale artifacts of linear matrix
        blending.
  - [ ] Measure both against the matrix path on the same scene before making
        motors the only path.
  - Octonions are non-associative, so a chain of transforms has no well-defined
    result; they stay out unless a concrete use turns up.

- **Archetype storage instead of classic ECS**
  - [ ] Replace the classic ECS with archetype storage: one contiguous SoA
        block per archetype over flat memory, walked linearly, with no virtual
        calls.
  - [ ] Target 1,000,000 entities updated in 6 ms in one thread on the FX-9590,
        the figure already observed there, then find the ceiling.
  - The A-infinity and Grothendieck-sheaf framing describes this layout rather
    than prescribing one: a section of a sheaf over flat memory is an
    archetype, and the gluing is the archetype table. What pays off is the
    contiguity and the absent dispatch, so build that and keep the vocabulary
    for the write-up.

- **Adelic storage**
  - [ ] Spike: split one logical array into layers by access frequency and
        locality instead of keeping it contiguous, so the hot part stays in
        cache and the cold part is uploaded once.
  - [ ] Acceptance: no allocation in the frame loop and a zero-copy upload path
        to the GPU, measured against a plain SoA array. If the layered version
        does not beat SoA on the fixed scene, drop it.
  - The p-adic metric names the tiering rule; the gain, if any, comes from the
    tiering and from the upload that does not copy.

- **Closed-form shading instead of loops**
  - [ ] Remove ray marching from the absorption path: evaluate the integral in
        closed form, as a sum of modes, instead of stepping through a 3D
        texture, targeting 15 ALU instructions where 64 steps were needed.
  - [ ] Treat a loop or a branch in a fragment shader as a defect that has to be
        justified; a closed form exists more often than it looks.
  - The holonomic D-module formalism is where such a closed form comes from;
    the shader only needs the result. This item waits until there is a
    volumetric or absorptive effect in the scene to measure it on.

### Frame loop

- [ ] After archetype storage: split update, upload and record into explicit
      stages, flatten the tree into (drawable, world matrix) chunks in draw
      order, and run update and record on `totalCPUs - 1` workers with static
      chunking.
- [ ] Frame model: per-worker command pool and bump arena reset at the frame
      barrier, no allocation in the frame, per-frame fences first, per-slot
      staging for joints. The deferred destruction queue recycles its nodes
      through a shared free list.
- [ ] Keep recording in draw order so blending is unchanged; judge against the
      single-threaded path on 1k / 10k / 100k drawables and keep recording
      single-threaded until those numbers exist.

Not parallelized: present, event polling, swapchain maintenance, pipeline and
shader creation.
