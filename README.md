(It's a testing ground now)

The rules are simple:

* The code is D-ideomatic
* No premature optimization
* Games support is important, but Vulkan is used not only for games but also for creating GUI, industry graphics and headless computing.
Don't forget about that.
* Ideas, patches, discussions, bugreports are welcome!
